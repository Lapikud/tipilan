2. **7.2** Only referees may assign penalties.
3. **7.3** The referee informs both the content of the violation and the assigned penalty to the rule-violating player, their team, and the opposing team. Additional information may be added as needed.
4. **7.4** The referee must first confirm the violation and only then assign the penalty. A penalty cannot have a suitable violation "invented" for it.
5. **7.5** The referee must be impartial; team skill level should not be decisive in monitoring violations and penalties.
6. **7.6** Penalties may be assigned to both the entire team and individual team members.
7. **7.7** The content of a penalty may be valid for either one game or the entire tournament participation period.
8. **7.8** A team cannot protest penalties assigned to the opposing team.
9. **7.9** Penalties may be as follows:
   1. **7.9.1 WARNING:** a warning is a recorded notice to a player or team for a minor violation.
   2. **7.9.2 BAN LOSS:** The team may not ban a certain number of characters in the game following the penalty. In this case, the referee monitors that the team does not select the penalty-specified number of bans and instead lets the timer run to zero.
   3. **7.9.3 GAME LOSS:** The team receives an automatic loss in one game.
   4. **7.9.4 MATCH LOSS:** The team receives an automatic match loss.
   5. **7.9.5 DISQUALIFICATION:** Disqualification applies to the entire team. In this case, the team forfeits all victories. If disqualification results from escalating violations, the team gets the portion of victories they had earned by that point.
      - In some cases, the referee is allowed to disqualify only one player instead of the team. This is the case when the player's violation does not affect the opposing team in any way and was done without involving anyone from their own team. Generally, this is possible when the player's violation falls under the category of Inappropriate Behavior - Serious Violation. In this case, the remaining team may continue in the tournament if a substitute player is available. Otherwise, the entire team must also be eliminated from the tournament.
10. **7.10** Penalty severity levels are as follows:
    Warning - warning - loss of ban selection right - game loss - match loss - disqualification
11. **7.11** Tournament violations are divided as follows:
    1. **7.11.1 EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE USE:** this violation is recorded when a team communicates during the game with anyone other than their own team and, as a result, in the referee's judgment, gains an advantage in the game. For this violation, it is assumed that it was not an intentional attempt to cheat. Intentionally seeking unfair advantage falls under the Inappropriate Behavior - Cheating category. The penalty is a warning.
    2. **7.11.2 IGNORING INSTRUCTIONS:** Every player has an obligation to follow Organizer and referee instructions. Ignoring them may result in delays and disputes. The penalty is loss of first selection right.
12. **7.12** Inappropriate behavior.
Inappropriate behavior disrupts tournament flow and may negatively affect safety, competitive spirit, game enjoyment, or tournament fairness and integrity. Inappropriate behavior is not the same as competitive behavior.
Inappropriate behavior violations are divided into:
    1. **7.12.1 MINOR VIOLATION:** this includes behavior that is unpleasant, unethical, or disruptive, such as excessive profanity; demanding that the opponent receive a penalty after the referee has made their decision; trash talking; littering, etc.
The penalty for minor violations is a warning.
    2. **7.12.2 MODERATE VIOLATION:** this includes three different types of violations
       - ignores referee or Organizer instructions meant specifically for one team or one player
       - uses hate speech publicly against someone
       - is aggressive or violent, but it is not directed at another person
The penalty for moderate violations is game loss.
    3. **7.12.3 SERIOUS VIOLATION:** this includes behavior that is clearly contrary to tournament conduct rules and good practices, such as intentionally breaking tournament equipment or dirtying or damaging the room. The penalty for serious violations is disqualification, removal from tournament premises, or in extreme cases, the Organizer informs the police.
    4. **7.12.4 MATCH FIXING:** match fixing is considered an agreement between two teams to play unfairly against other teams and attempt to influence tournament results.
The penalty for match fixing is disqualification of both teams.
    5. **7.12.5 BRIBERY AND BETTING:** teams are forbidden from withdrawing from the tournament or attempting to change match results for any favor (not necessarily just monetary). It is also forbidden to offer referees incentives to influence game results. Betting on game results is also forbidden.
The penalty for bribery and betting is disqualification.
    6. **7.12.6 AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR:** this includes all manifestations of aggression directed at people, including threats and obviously real violence.
The penalty is disqualification and removal from premises, in extreme cases the Organizer informs the police.
    7. **7.12.7 THEFT:** although every participant has an obligation to keep an eye on their property, there is still an expectation that participant behavior is consistent with good practices.
The penalty for theft is disqualification and removal from premises. If the situation cannot be resolved on-site, the Organizer informs the police.
    8. **7.12.8 ALCOHOL AND INTOXICATION:** Alcohol consumption within the event is forbidden. In case of excessive intoxication, the Organizer has the right to remove the participant from the premises.
       - if the intoxicated participant is underage, their parents and police will be informed.
    9. **7.12.9 CHEATING:** this includes intentional player action to gain an advantage in the game. Cheating does not have to be successful to result in penalty.
Activities that fall under cheating include, for example:
       - attempting to view one's own game in spectator mode or receiving information from someone who can watch the game in spectator mode
       - any attempt to modify the game itself or use additional software not normally included with the game, including changing in-game zoom, using UI modifications that change attack range or make tower firing range visible, using spawn timers, etc. VOIP program use does not fall under this category.
       - appearing as another player or under a false name, playing using another player's summoner name, or account sharing
       - intentionally breaking or attempting to modify equipment to cause delays, get pauses, or otherwise influence game flow
       - intentional exploitation of in-game bugs to gain advantage, i.e., using various glitches to one's benefit.
The penalty for cheating is disqualification.

## 8. Tournament Format

1. **8.1** The tournament operates on Fearless Draft principles. This means that champions picked during a series cannot be picked in subsequent games until the series ends.
2. **8.2** The tournament operates in Round Robin + Single Elimination format
This means the first round consists of 2 groups of 6 teams each, where all teams play each other once. This determines the 4 best teams, who advance to the next day's single elimination bracket.
   1. **8.2.1** In case of a tie in groups, the team that won the match between the tied teams advances.
